- In the Dashboard folder, you can find a notebook called "E_Dashboard.ipynb" this is just a notebook I was trying things before implementing them on the Dashboard, you can find the Dashboard in the "vinv" folder. Also there is a markdown file called "README.md", you will find in it some findings after building the Dashboard.
